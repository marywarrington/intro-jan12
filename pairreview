Folder: Uppercase

Whitespace:
Some wasted empty lines

HTML:
The div#uppercase doesn't really need the p or span tags to change its effectiveness

Folder: letter
Error: The name field turns into [OBJECT HTMLSPANELEMENT] when you use the page in chrome.
This is caused in the js file .toUpperCase needs to be .toUpperCase()
